# Unveiling Hidden Customer Segments Through E-commerce Purchase Patterns

## Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.  The analysis aims to uncover hidden patterns and insights that can inform targeted marketing campaigns and optimize product offerings.  The project utilizes various data visualization and statistical techniques to segment customers and understand their unique characteristics.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NumPy (implicitly used by other libraries)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, install the necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the analysis to the console, including descriptive statistics about customer segments and their purchasing habits.  Additionally, the analysis generates several visualization files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, potentially others depending on the analysis performed) which are saved in the project directory.  These visualizations provide a visual representation of the identified customer segments and their respective purchase patterns.  The specific visualizations generated will be documented within the code.


## Data

The data used for this analysis should be placed in a file named `ecommerce_data.csv` in the project's root directory.  The expected format of this CSV file should be documented within the code.  Please ensure that the data adheres to this format.
